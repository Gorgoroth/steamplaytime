This is the source code for my site [Steamplaytime](http://steamplaytime.appspot.com). It interfaces with the Steam API and [howlongtobeat.com](http://howlongtobeat.com) to make various estimates about your Steam account, including:

* The estimated hours it would take to complete all the games on your Steam account
* The worth (in USD) of your Steam account
* Estimates about the required time to beat any game on Steam (in particular those on your account)
